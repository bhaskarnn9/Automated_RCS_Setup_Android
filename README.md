Hello.

To run the project, simply clone it and import into android studio.

To Automate the setup:
1. Connect your phone to the development machine
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Select the drop down menu where it says "App" with a little Android minion symbol
4. Click Edit Configuration
5. Click "+"
6. Enter name : I gave it "AIT", which means Android Instrumenation Test
7. Select Module "App"
8. Click Apply and OK
9. Select the drop down menu where it says "App" with a little Android minion symbol and select newly added AIT module. This will run Instrumentation Test which has code to automate setup
10. Click run "A > Play button". Boom. 

Troubleshooting : Incase you do not see setup running on your device, simple tap the app that's newly installed on your phone. It should say "Automated....".


Thanks.
